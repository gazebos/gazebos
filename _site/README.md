# gazebos

Bite-sized [WebVR](https://webvr.rocks/) experiences.

**[Try it out!](https://gazebos.io/)**


## Usage

1. [Load **https://gazebos.io/**](https://gazebos.io/), and _dive_ right in!
2. Add your [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/docs/) scene markup to `_scenes/<username>/<scene>.html`.
3. Find some _public-domain_ assets (or, better yet: make your own assets from scratch).
4. Use the various tools in the [`_tools`](_tools) directory: for trimming videos to be <= 10 seconds long, for downloading YouTube/Vimeo videos, images from Flickr (e.g., [these equirectangular ones](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/)), and a boilerplate for launching Chrome headlessly (if you want to do some automation/site scraping).
5. Thank you for building and [sharing](#contributing) your creativity!
